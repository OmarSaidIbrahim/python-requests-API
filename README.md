# python-requests-API
This project is to demonstrate how accurate is to retrieve data using APIs instead of automatas based on layout and dynamic data.

The project will use River Island again as target shop to retrieve the products in the shops near the user location.

DUE TO COVID-19 THEY DISABLED THE APIs.
